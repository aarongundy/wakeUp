Python Alarm Clock

Mission
The goal of this project is to create an alarm clock on a Raspberry Pi that is extremely customizable and reliable.


Long-Term Goals
---------------

*Fully functioning alarm system editable and customizable with different sounds

*Read in weather from internet source

*Suggested Clothing for the day i.e. Rain Jacket, Winter Coat, T-Shirt, Shorts

*Perhaps Sync with Google Calender and tell you important events happening


Important Notes
--------------
Playing sound currently relies on a WAV file called "alarm_beeping.wav" in the same directory
